### Backend for Order management

The order management system will be implemented as a set of serverless functions deployed on Firebase. These functions will handle various tasks related to managing orders. Specifically, when an order is received, the order management system will perform the following actions:

1. Send the necessary information to the payment processor for payment processing.
2. Send the information to the tip processor for handling tips.
3. Add the order to the database.
4. Update the order status accordingly.
5. Send out appropriate notifications.

### Backend for product management

Another set of serverless functions will be dedicated to the management of products and menus from restaurants. These functions will store the products added by restaurant managers and allow applications to query this information. The backend for product management will be read-only for client applications and will be populated using the restaurant management system.

### Payment Processor

The payment processor is a separate component that requires special attention to ensure its reliability. It will handle payment processing for orders placed through the system.

### User Management

The user manager service will handle all functionality and data related to user management. It will be responsible for updating user information, storing user data, providing functionality for credit or reward systems, and keeping track of used coupons. Any tasks related to user management will be handled by this service.

These components add up to a total of nine pieces of software that need to be developed. Each of these parts will have its own internal architecture to ensure proper integration into the overall product architecture.

## Product Architecture

Let's take a quick look at how we intend to build up the product architecture. This will give us a clear picture of what is dependent on which parts which will eventually lead us to a development plan to start the creation of this system.

![Architecture Dependencies](../resources/images/architecture-dependencies.png)

## Frontend Components

1. Customer Web App: This is the web application where customers can browse products, add items to their cart, place orders, and manage their profiles.

2. Customer Mobile App: A mobile application that provides similar functionalities as the web app, allowing customers to access your eCommerce platform from their mobile devices.

3. Admin Web App: An administration web application that enables administrators to manage products, inventory, orders, and customer data.

4. Delivery Driver Mobile App: A mobile application for delivery drivers to receive delivery requests, navigate to customer locations, and update order statuses.

## Backend Components

1. API Gateway: Serves as a single entry point for all client applications and routes requests to the appropriate microservices.

2. Authentication Service: Handles user authentication and authorization, providing secure access to customer and admin functionalities.
Product Catalog Service: Manages the product catalog, including information such as product details, categories, pricing, and availability.
3. Inventory Service: Tracks product inventory levels and ensures accurate stock management.

4. Cart Service: Handles cart functionality, allowing customers to add/remove items, calculate totals, and prepare for checkout.

5. Order Service: Manages the order lifecycle, including order placement, payment processing, order fulfillment, and order history.

6. User Service: Handles user management functionality, including user registration, profile management, and address book.

7. Payment Service: Integrates with payment processors to handle secure payment transactions and process payments for placed orders.

8. Notification Service: Sends out notifications to customers, administrators, and delivery drivers regarding order updates, status changes, and other relevant information.

9. Delivery Service: Provides functionalities for assigning delivery drivers to orders, tracking delivery status, and optimizing delivery routes.

10. Analytics Service: Collects and analyzes data related to customer behavior, sales, and other key metrics to provide insights for business decision-making.

## Infrastructure

1. Database: Stores data related to products, inventory, orders, users, and other relevant information.

2. Content Delivery Network (CDN): Speeds up content delivery by caching static assets such as product images and customer profile pictures.

3. Payment Gateway: Integrates with third-party payment processors to securely handle payment transactions.

4. Message Queue: Enables asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

5. Caching Layer: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data, such as product catalog information and customer profiles.

## Development Phases

This section describes the phases of development where we will have "Major" version releases. A product of this size is never built in one go, in fact, the separate components as shown above is not even built to completion in any phase. We've moved away from Waterfall a while back and the most successful software companies do incremental work / updates given we're almost the only field in engineering that can do that without any additional cost. We'll have multiple phases marked by specific functionality being in that phase which will give us a nice break down of what to work on in order to complete the development of this application.

The phases are all dependent on the architecture dependency graph you see above, the parts with the most dependencies will most likely be built first so we can allow for multiple other parts to be worked on as well. Lets go over a basic high level view of some of the phases.

1. Requirement Gathering and Planning: Understand the specific requirements of your eCommerce app. Identify key features such as product browsing, search, shopping cart, checkout, order management, user authentication, and payment integration. Plan the overall structure and flow of the app.

2. UI/UX Design: Design the UI and UX of your eCommerce app. Create wireframes and mockups for screens like home page, product listing, product details, cart, user profile, and order history. Focus on creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface that aligns with your brand identity.

3. Development Environment Setup: Set up your Flutter development environment as mentioned earlier. Ensure you have the necessary tools and configurations to develop for both iOS and Android platforms.

4. Architecture and Data Model Design: Design the app's architecture, considering a modular approach. Identify key components such as product catalog, cart management, order processing, user authentication, and payment integration. Choose a suitable state management approach, such as Provider or Riverpod, to handle app-wide data.

5. Backend Development: Develop the backend APIs and database structures required for your eCommerce app. Implement functionalities like user authentication, product catalog management, inventory management, and order processing. Choose a backend technology stack that aligns with your requirements, such as Node.js, Django, or Firebase.

6. Frontend Development: Implement the UI screens and functionalities using Flutter. Build screens for browsing products, viewing product details, adding items to the cart, managing the cart, and placing orders. Implement user authentication screens like login, registration, and profile management. Integrate with backend APIs to fetch data and handle user interactions.

7. Testing: Perform thorough testing of your eCommerce app. Test different scenarios such as browsing products, adding items to the cart, placing orders, and managing user profiles. Ensure proper validation and error handling. Test payment integrations using sandbox or test environments. Perform unit tests and integration tests to ensure the app's stability and functionality.

8. Deployment: Prepare your eCommerce app for deployment. Generate the necessary build artifacts for Android and iOS platforms. Optimize the app's performance, handle platform-specific configurations, and ensure compliance with app store guidelines. Publish your app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

9. Monitoring and Maintenance: Monitor the app's performance, user feedback, and analytics after deployment. Continuously update and improve the app based on user feedback and market trends. Address any bug reports, enhance features, and optimize user experience. Keep the product catalog up to date and ensure smooth order processing and inventory management.
